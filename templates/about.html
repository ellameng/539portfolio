				<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 introduction">Hi! I'm Ella, first year Health Informatics graduate student in the  <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu" class="introlink" target="_blank"> School of Information </a> & <a href="https://sph.umich.edu" class="introlink" target="_blank">School of Public Health</a> at <a href="http://umich.edu" class="introlink" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a>. With much curiosity and interest in website design, I am taking <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/courses/539" class="introlink" target="_blank">SI 539 Design of Complex Websites</a> class this semester. I have to say, it was not smooth at the beginning and it was sometimes even frustrating. Everything except Python, which I learned last year, like Google App Engine, HTML, CSS, all looked like #$^&%*!#%~@^ in my head... However, thanks to my funny and enthusiastic professor, cute and knowledgeable GSI, nice and supportive friends, as well as smart and diligent me, I was taught the right way and achieved progress. Thank you guys! I really appreciate all your support and help. Through it all, I love designing and coding now!
